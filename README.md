Personal portfolio website for myself.


I have used a fusion of cutting-edge technologies to create my portfolio website, which is yet to be developed further and optimised. With ThreeJS, witness 3D graphics brought to life through fluid rendering and animations. Experience interactive 3D realms seamlessly woven into React with React Three Fibre. Tailwind CSS grants elegance and functionality, while Framer Motion adds immersive animations. From intricate 3D models to optimised camera work, I've mastered ThreeJS and React Three Fibre, utilising industry best practises for scalability.
